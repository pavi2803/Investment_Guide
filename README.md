## Optimal Investment Split Application
This application assists investors in making optimal investment decisions by evaluating multiple company options. It utilizes advanced optimization techniques to determine the best stock allocation for a given portfolio.

### About This Application
In the realm of investing, choosing the right allocation for your portfolio is crucial. With numerous companies and investment options available, it can be challenging to determine the optimal investment split. This application simplifies this decision-making process by implementing the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Algorithm.

The application uses covariance and correlation analysis to evaluate the relationships between different stocks and identify the best investment split. By optimizing the portfolio, it aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

### Features
* Optimal Investment Split: Calculates the best stock allocation for your investment portfolio.
* Covariance and Correlation Analysis: Uses these statistical techniques to evaluate relationships between stocks and enhance portfolio optimization.
* Markowitz Portfolio Algorithm: Implements this classic optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal investment split.
* Realtime Data Fetch : From Yahoo Finance

### Tech Stack
